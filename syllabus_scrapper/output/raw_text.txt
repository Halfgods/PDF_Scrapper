Preamble: 
Greetings and congratulations to all the education partners Fr Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering 
for getting autonomous status to the college from the year 2024-25. University Grant Commission vide 
letter No. F. 2-10/2023(AC-Policy) dated 23rd Nov 2023 conferred the autonomous status to Fr. Conceicao 
Rodrigues College of Engineering, Fr. Agnel Ashram, Bandstand, Bandra (West), Mumbai 400050 affiliated 
to University of Mumbai for a period of 10 years from the academic year 2024-2025 to 2033-2034 as per 
clause 7.5 of the UGC (Conferment of Autonomous Status Upon Colleges and Measures for Maintenance 
of Standards in Autonomous Colleges) Regulations,2023. We look towards autonomy as a great opportunity 
to design and implement curriculum sensitive to needs of Learner, Indian Society and Industries.  
Government of Maharashtra has also directed Autonomous Colleges to revise their curriculum in line with 
National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 through Government Resolution dated 4th July 2023. We commit to 
ourselves to the effective implementation of UGC Regulations and NEP 2020 in its spirit. 
 
Based on recent recommendations of the GR, we are pleased to offer our holistic curriculum for 2024-28, 
a “H-Tree Model” of Engineering Education. A unique “H-Tree Model” of Engineering Education Curriculum 
is carefully designed to systematically develop IQ (Intelligence Quotient), PQ (Physical Quotient), EQ 
(Emotional Quotient) and SQ (Spiritual Quotient) of a learner. This curriculum aims at the development of 
an all-rounded personality with holistic approach to education in which learner receives 25% teacher-led 
learning, 25% peer learning, 25% self-learning and 25% experiential learning. The curriculum model is 
outcome based that focuses on learning by doing. Curriculum is designed to provide multiple learning 
opportunities for students to acquire and demonstrate competencies for rewarding careers. It ensures 
multiple choices to leaner acquiring skills through systematic planning. It has 7 verticals aligned to GR 
recommendations with strong science, and mathematics foundation and program core, sequel of electives, 
Multidisciplinary Minor courses, humanities & management courses and sufficient experiential learning 
through projects and semester-long industry / research internship along with employable skill-based 
courses. Learner gets an opportunity to acquire skills through NSDC aligned courses during summer 
vacations.  Learner also gets additional option to choose the kind of degree i.e. Honors or Double Minor or 
Honors with Research.  
Various steps are taken to transform teaching learning process to make learning a joyful experience for 
students. We believe that this curriculum will raise the bar of academic standards with the active 
involvement and cooperation from students, academic and administrative units.
